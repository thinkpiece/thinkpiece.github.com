With the start of a new year, many people set their New Year's resolution
traditionally. Well, me too. Looking backward on my resolutions from
the last year, I've realized that I'd changed a lot so far. First of all,
I decided to start up a new business with my professor while I worked as a
postdoctral researcher, so I'd refused several job offers: opportunities for
working in big companies. Me and my professor founded our own company to start
up a business on the vision System-on-Chip market in last August, and, so far,
we didn't yet face the real tough time. I expect this coming year to be a tough
year that I have to focus on the sucessful business.


Here are my 2016 resolutions:

* Read for at least 25 minutes a day
* Do at least 3 exercises a week
* Writing 2 journal papers on my previous research (simulation, SoC)
* The new open office by the middle of this year
* Establish fully completed Vision SoC for sucessful business
* Understand Deep Learning
