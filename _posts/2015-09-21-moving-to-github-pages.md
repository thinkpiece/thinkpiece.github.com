For the past few years, I've posted several articles on several blog services
as travelling from place to place rather than using one service. Cyworld,
Naver Blogs, Tistory, Wordpress, Tumblr, the list I've used goes on and on.
In the end, I switched to GitHub pages. As of right now my first impression
was great. It'd be nice to be able to use Markdown directly to post an article!

Check out my previous blogs on my [Tistory blog][my-tistory] (Korean) for more
info on topics I'd like to discuss and share. It'll be mostly on my personal
thoughts on research and expreience.
