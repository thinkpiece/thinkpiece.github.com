Hi, there.

I'm JY, currently a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST. I majored in Electrical
Engineering, with a focus on the intelligent vision System-on-Chip (SoC)
design. My research interests mainly focus on energy-efficient SoC, mapping
from software to hardware, especially for computer vision and machine learning
algorithms.
